Due to vague instructions for setting up the database additional files and instructions were provided:
1. Upon Accessing PHPMYAdmin on the wamp server, create a database called web_proj.
2. Next Select the web_proj database and import the script located in the sql folder called "web_proj.sql".
3. Proceed to index.php and login using username: admin and password: adminpass.

NB: Any user with admin in thier username will be considered an admin. So to make a new admin, include admin within the username.
